<p class="tipsp">
Planning ahead of your tour to Gwadar can be very much useful and make your experience more delightful, smooth and fulfilling Here are some useful tips to keep in mind:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Travel Permits:</strong> Foreign tourists may require a No objection certificate(NOC) while visiting Gwadar unlike citizens who can travel freely</li>
    <li><strong>Road Travel:</strong> Makran coastal highway is well maintained and smooth, but carrying extra fuel, snacks and water can save you in case of emergency</li>
    <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> The efficiency or mobile signals can vary in patchy areas due to lack of network infrastructure</li>
    <li><strong>Clothing:</strong> Local customs and traditions must be respected when it comes to clothing especially when visiting rural areas</li>
    <li><strong>Cash is King:</strong> ATMs may not be available in remote areas so carry enough cash while travelling</li>
    <li><strong>Language:</strong> Languages spoken locally are Urdu and Balochi so most of the times people won‚Äôt understand English. Use of google translator can ease communication</li>
    <li><strong>Accommodation:</strong> To avoid any problems, always book in advance whether you want to stay in a luxury or standard hotel. During holidays, hotels running out of rooms is very common.</li>
